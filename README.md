# 🧬 Genetic Algorithm Projects

This repository contains a collection of optimization problems solved using **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** in Python.  
Each subfolder is a standalone project with its own explanation, implementation, and optional visualization.

## 📁 Projects Included

| Project                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| 🗺️ [Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)](./TSP) | Find the shortest tour visiting all cities once and returning to the start. |
| 👑 [N-Queens Problem](./N-Queens)             | Place N queens on an NxN board without attacking each other. |
| 🎒 [0/1 Knapsack Problem](./Knapsack)         | Choose a subset of items to maximize value within weight capacity. |
